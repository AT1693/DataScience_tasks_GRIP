# DataScience_tasks_TSF_Internship

Implementation of the following tasks is done in this repository:-

1. To Explore Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of
marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear
regression task as it involves just two variables.


2.  To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of
clusters and represent it visually.


3.  To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
